# System Architecture

## Bot Architecture
The application follows a dual command architecture supporting both Discord.js slash commands and traditional prefix commands (!). The main entry point (`index.js`) initializes the Discord client with necessary intents for guild, voice state, and message interactions. 

**📁 Project Structure:**
- `src/` - Core application modules (database.js, spotify.js)  
- `utils/` - Utility modules (health.js)
- `scripts/youtube/` - YouTube player scripts with proper naming
- `commands/` - Slash command modules
- `config/` - Bot configuration files
- Root directory - Main entry point and configuration files only

Commands are implemented both as modular files in the `commands/` directory and as inline prefix command handlers with complete error handling and security fixes.

## Music System Design
The core music functionality is built around an enhanced guild-specific queue system using JavaScript Maps for data storage. Each guild has its own `MusicQueue` instance that manages songs, playback state, volume, loop settings, autoplay, shuffle mode, and playback history. The system supports multiple audio sources with intelligent fallback mechanisms.

## Multi-Source Audio Processing
Audio streaming supports three main sources:
- **YouTube**: Direct URLs and search queries using ytdl-core and play-dl with fallback
- **Spotify**: Track and playlist URLs converted to YouTube equivalents via Spotify API
- **SoundCloud**: Direct streaming using soundcloud-downloader

## Command Structure
**Slash Commands**: 
- Individual modules in `commands/` directory (26 files)
- Dynamic registration system scans and loads all command files automatically
- Proper routing with validation and error handling
- Works with interaction.deferReply() for non-trivial commands

**Prefix Commands**: 
- Centralized handler in index.js with comprehensive error handling
- Shortcuts mapping: !p → play, !s → skip, !st → stop, !stat → status, etc.
- All commands have aliases for faster usage

**Interactive Controls**: 
- Button-based controls with proper customId mapping
- Supports both short IDs (skip, stop, loop) and legacy IDs (music_skip, music_stop)
- Null-safe operators for robust error handling
- Try-catch blocks in stop/cleanup operations

## Enhanced Queue Management
- Maximum 100 songs per queue with overflow protection
- Shuffle functionality with randomization algorithm
- Loop mode for repeating current track
- Autoplay system using YouTube's related video suggestions
- Playback history tracking (last 10 songs)
- Position tracking and queue navigation

## State Management
The bot maintains enhanced persistent state through in-memory storage using JavaScript Maps. Includes music queues, audio players, voice connections, user preferences, and playback statistics. All state is guild-specific and includes advanced features like autoplay settings and shuffle state.

# Available Commands

## Prefix Commands (! shortcuts)
- `!p` / `!play` - Play music from YouTube, Spotify, or SoundCloud
- `!s` / `!skip` - Skip current track
- `!st` / `!stp` / `!stop` - Stop playback and clear queue (FIXED: now correctly stops)
- `!stat` / `!ping` - Show bot status and uptime
- `!ps` / `!pause` - Pause current track
- `!r` / `!resume` - Resume paused track
- `!v` / `!volume` - Set volume (1-100)

- `!ap` / `!autoplay` - Toggle autoplay
- `!h` / `!help` - Show comprehensive help
- `!j` / `!join` - Join voice channel
- `!lv` / `!leave` - Leave voice channel

**Note**: !st was previously mapped to status, now correctly mapped to stop for better UX

## Interactive Controls
- ⏸️ Pause/Resume button
- ⏭️ Skip track button  
- ⏹️ Stop and clear queue button
- 🔀 Shuffle queue button
- 🔁 Toggle loop button
- 🎵 Toggle autoplay button
- 🔊/🔉 Volume up/down buttons
- 📋 Quick queue display button

The bot requires Discord Bot Token configuration and appropriate Discord application permissions including voice channel access, message sending, slash command registration, and message content intent for prefix commands.
